# 3. Update the following variables with your Google Cloud project ID, BigQuery dataset ID, and table ID.
# 4. Authenticate to Google Cloud: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started

PROJECT_ID = "your-gcp-project-id"
DATASET_ID = "your-bq-dataset-id"
TABLE_ID = "your-bq-table-id"
GCS_BUCKET = "your-gcs-bucket-name"
DATASET_FILES = ["your-dataset-file.csv"]
